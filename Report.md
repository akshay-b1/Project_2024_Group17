# CSCE 435 Group project

## 0. Group number: 17

## 1. Group members:
1. Jeffrey Slobodkin
2. Aayush Garg
3. Akshay Belhe
4. Jesung Ha

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort: Jesung Ha
- Sample Sort: Aayush Garg
- Merge Sort: Jeffrey Slobodkin
- Radix Sort: Akshay Belhe

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
